## Things to do
We will try to spend as much time with you as possible, but I'm pretty sure there will be time for exploring the city on your own. For this I thought to give you a few options.

### Ruin bars
Budapest is famous for its ruin bars and pubs. It is a unique style and with the relatively cheap prices of Budapest (thanks to inflation...) you can relax and enjoy a few drinks in these quirky spaces. A few well known ones are below, but you can run into them around Deak Ter anywhere.

### Buda Castle and the Fisherman's Bastion
An absolut must, both offer gorgeous architecture and views over the city. I would recommend going there after dark or around sunset. There are some nice restaurants to have dinner around sunset, my favourite in the area is Ramazuri Bistronomy [ℹ️](https://goo.gl/maps/TYfwaHyxgZe8nGdh7).

Pro tip: go to the Fisherman's bastion first around sunset. The sun sets on the other side bit the lights are amazing. Then head to the Buda Castle, walk around and find the way down next to the Castle. The night view from the Buda castle over the city is one of a kind.


### Szent Istvan Bazilika

At the real beating heart of Budapest is St. Stephen's Basilica, a beatiful sight and the center of the most vibrant and entertaining parts of Budapest. You can walk around and enjoy the city. You can also go up to the top for a relatively low fare, but you have to be ok with stairs. The views are really nice from up there. If you want an amazing Gelato while you are walking around pick the one opposite the Basilica, the one with the queue. You'll know when you get there [ℹ️](https://g.page/GelartoRosa?share).

### Margaret Island
The Central Park of Budapest, you can rent 4 seater bikes and other funky ways of transportation and explore. Lots of gardens, weird hobbies on display, people chilling, playing sports, having a picnic. Nice walk on a nice day or evening.

### Baths

Budapest is famous for its baths. The main one is Szechenyi [ℹ️](https://goo.gl/maps/JWGaosx3yFaDHLa28), which will wow you with its facilities and architecture. The oldest one is Rudas [ℹ️](https://goo.gl/maps/CmXoHkWzgC3ECbkr6), which has an old Turkish bath on one side and some modern facilities on the other. There is also Gellert [ℹ️](https://goo.gl/maps/QXQa5UjCkxyoqUzU8), which is actually more interesting on a hot day with its outdoor pools and nice vibes.

### Chair lift to the nearby mountain

The chair lift is a cool thing to do on a beatiful day, gets you away from the business of the city and takes you to closer to nature

## Coffee
If you are a coffee enthusiast like me, Budapest is a great place. My absolute favourite cappuccino is in Cirkusz, which is always packed for brunch but if you only want a nice coffee they can squeeze you in at the bar for a quick one. Honestly worth it, they roast the beans themselves.

Also noteworthy cafes:

## Restaurants

Budapest has a buzzing restaurant scene with lots of traditional and fusion restaurants. But it is important to remember that it still has some tourist traps and mediocre eateries that are best to avoid.

*If you don't know the restaurant, check the google reviews. If it is near a tourist place and plays live music, be suspicious :)*

Here are a few exceptional places we collected over the last couple of years:

### Barack es Szilva
Cute little place in the city, has a French vibe about it. Their food never disappoints. You can honestly eat anything, they are all high quality.
My favourite is the Chicken Paprikash with a glass of red wine - they can recommend one that goes well with your dish. Also their Foie Gras as a starter is to die for. [ℹ️](https://goo.gl/maps/neN8PeSJpeRUUaCo8)

### Vendiak
Best Chicken soup (Husleves) in town! Great little place with outside seating available, chill and nice vibes. [ℹ️](https://g.page/Vendiak?share)

### Kazimir bistro
Our old favourite place recently reopened! Super friendly service and each of their dishes are prepared with love and nice little Hungarian touch.

### Vakvarju
It's a chain, the best one is the one near Deak Ter. It's an old favourite, never disappoints. You can try anything, it won't disappoint.

### Cirkusz
Best brunch place in town. But it is always crazy busy. Maybe if you go early of late you might get a table.
But if you are walking past and don't see a queue, do hop in for a cappuccino - their coffee is to die for. They roast their own coffee beans.

### Divin Porcello
A hidden little gem for meat lovers. This place specialises on meat, so I would recommend something heavy there :) Or a nice chicken soup or gulyas.

### Belvarosi disznotoros
A meat heavy experience in two great locations. It is a must try for lunch if sausages are up your ally. My recommendation for 2 or 3 people:
Order one fried red sausage (kolbász), one liver sausage (májas hurka) and one blood sausage (véres hurka) with the potatoes with onions (hagymás burgonya).
And if you like pickles they have a pickle bar where you can pick your fancy. You will need some to help digest all the sausages...
Also add some mustard, that's how the locals eat it.

                <h2>How to get there?</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Airport to train station</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can easily take a taxi from the airport, but only use the ones parking right outside the terminal.
                <br><i>On your way out you will be approached by unofficial taxi drivers, never take a ride with them!</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can book a transfer here: <a href="https://bookinbudapest.com/airport-transfer-budapest">bookinbudapest.com/airport-transfer-budapest</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                By public transport you can buy the tickets from a vending machine outside the terminal and hop on the bus to one of the Metro stations.
                From there you can go by M3 to Kalvin ter and change to M4 for Kelenfold station.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will need a separate ticket for the bus and the metro, but once underground you can change trains with no extra charge.

                We've been asked what we would like for a gift and the answer is simple: You, at our wedding, having a great time.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you insist then we will say...

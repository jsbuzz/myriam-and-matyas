# Budapest Birthday Bash

Welcome to Budapest, traveller. Here you can find tips and tricks, places to go, things to do... The good stuff.

## The Party
On Saturday night we are going to TABLE Suite Restaurant & Event Space [‚ÑπÔ∏è](https://goo.gl/maps/H6CZFwVPv2NXRjWm7) and have food and cocktails. It is a private event venue booked only for us, food and soft drinks are free for the guests - buffet style.

üè† The address is *Budapest, Kir√°ly u. 53* 3rd floor. There is a buzzer for the venue if the door is not open. It is a residential building, it used to be a large flat that was then converted to this event space and restaurant.

üßëüèΩ‚Äçü§ù‚ÄçüßëüèΩ Only amazing people, it is the perfect mixture of family and friends. A few children might be running around speaking all sorts of languages...

üßâ There will be a bar where a cocktail whisperer is going to make us all regret this party the next day... But there you can buy (üí≥ & üíµ) alcoholic beverages and cocktails to get the juices flowing.

üëò Dress smart casual, but if you fancy you can go all out. It's going to be a mix, I myself will opt for a chinos & shirt combo probably. Take a look at some photos of the venue and choose something that works for you.

üïï Party starts at 6pm with drinks.
```
6pm - 7pm     Welcome drinks
7pm - 9pm     Food is served

```

## Things to do
We will try to spend as much time with you as possible, but I'm pretty sure there will be time for exploring the city on your own. For this I thought to give you a few options.

### Ruin bars

### Buda Castle

### Szent Istvan Bazilika

### Margaret Island

### Baths

### Chair lift to the nearby mountain

The chair lift is a cool thing to do on a beatiful day, gets you away from the business of the city and takes you to closer to nature

## Restaurants

Budapest has a buzzing restaurant scene with lots of traditional and fusion restaurants. But it is important to remember that it still has some tourist traps and mediocre eateries that are best to avoid.

*If you don't know the restaurant, check the google reviews. If it is near a tourist place and plays live music, be suspicious :)*

Here are a few exceptional places we collected over the last couple of years:

### Barack es Szilva
Cute little place in the city, has a French vibe about it. Their food never disappoints. You can honestly eat anything, they are all high quality.
My favourite is the Chicken Paprikash with a glass of red wine - they can recommend one that goes well with your dish. Also their Foie Gras as a starter is to die for. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](https://goo.gl/maps/neN8PeSJpeRUUaCo8)


### Little Budapest
Such an amazing place, great for late dinner and cocktails. Great vibe, friendly service and five star food. Their Gulyas soup is a champ, but you can eat anything. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](https://g.page/littlebudapestrestaurantpianobar?share)

### Divin Porcello
A hidden little gem for meat lovers. This place specialises on meat, so I would recommend something heavy there :) Or a nice chicken soup or gulyas.

### Kazimir bistro
Our old favourite place recently reopened! Super friendly service and each of their dishes are prepared with love and nice little Hungarian touch.

### Vendiak
Best Chicken soup (Husleves) in town! Great little place with outside seating available, chill and nice vibes. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](https://g.page/Vendiak?share)

### Vakvarju
It's a chain, the best one is the one near Deak Ter. It's an old favourite, never disappoints. You can try anything, it won't disappoint.

### Cirkusz
Best brunch place in town. But it is always crazy busy. Maybe if you go early of late you might get a table.
But if you are walking past and don't see a queue, do hop in for a cappuccino - their coffee is to die for. They roast their own coffee beans.

### Belvarosi disznotoros
A meat heavy experience in two great locations. It is a must try for lunch if you sausages are up your ally. My recommendation for 2 or 3 people:
Order one fried red sausage (kolb√°sz), one liver sausage (m√°jas hurka) and one blood sausage (v√©res hurka) with the potatoes with onions (hagym√°s burgonya).
And if you like pickles they have a pickle bar where you can pick your fancy. You will need some to help digest all the sausages...
Pro tip is to add a slice of bread and mustard, they go well.

# Budapest Birthday Bash

Welcome to Budapest, traveller. Here you can find tips and tricks, places to go, things to do... The good stuff.

## Restaurants

Budapest has a buzzing restaurant scene with lots of fusion restaurants. But important to remember that it still has some tourist traps and mediocre
eateries that are best to avoid.

**If you don't know the restaurant, check the google reviews. If it is near a tourist place and plays live music, be suspicious :)**

Here is a few exceptional places we collected over time:

### Barack es Szilva
-- [Google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/neN8PeSJpeRUUaCo8) --  
Cute little place in the city, has a French vibe about it. Their food never disappoints. You can honestly eat anything, they are all high quality.
My favourite is the Chicken Paprikash with a glass of red wine - they can recommend one that goes well with your dish. Also their Foie Gras as a starter is to die for.

### Little Budapest
-- [Google maps](https://g.page/littlebudapestrestaurantpianobar?share) --  
Such an amazing place, great for late dinner and cocktails. Great vibe, friendly service and five star food. Their Gulyas soup is a champ, but you can eat anything.

### Divin Porcello
-- [Google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/wsyi3Z7c65wPBmJu5) --  
A hidden little gem for meat lovers. This place specialises on meat, so I would recommend something heavy there :) Or a nice chicken soup or gulyas.

### Kazimir bistro

Our old favourite place recently reopened! Super friendly service and each of their dishes are prepared with love and nice little Hungarian touch.

### Vendiak
-- [Google maps](https://g.page/Vendiak?share) --  
Best Chicken soup (Husleves) in town! Great little place with outside seating available, chill and nice vibes.

### Vakvarju

It's a chain, the best one is the one near Deak Ter. It's an old favourite, never disappoints. You can try anything, it won't disappoint.

### Cirkusz
-- [Google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/MkeYcPdSUWEAZqV6A) --  
Best brunch place in town. But it is always crazy busy. Maybe if you go early of late you might get a table.
But if you are walking past and don't see a queue, do hop in for a cappuccino - their coffee is to die for. They roast their own coffee beans.

### Belvarosi disznotoros

A meat heavy experience in two great locations. It is a must try for lunch if you sausages are up your ally. My recommendation for 2 or 3 people:
Order one fried red sausage (kolbász), one liver sausage (májas hurka) and one blood sausage (véres hurka) with the potatoes with onions (hagymás burgonya).
And if you like pickles they have a pickle bar where you can pick your fancy. You will need some to help digest all the sausages...
Pro tip is to add a slice of bread and mustard, they go well.
